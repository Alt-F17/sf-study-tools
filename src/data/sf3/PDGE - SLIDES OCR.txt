 5min Break!














				




What is a web page?
• What are they made up of?
• Write down a definition!
• De?nition: A web page is a ?le structured with
HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
• The HTML gives instructions to include:
• Text, images, videos, software components
• Hyperlinks to allow users to navigate between web pages
• Which layout and styles to apply to the page




				




What is a website?
• How do you know you're browsing one?
• Write down a definition!
• Definition: One or more web pages linked together.
• The pages have a common domain name
• What is an example of a domain name?
• We'll be coming back to this!









What tools do you need to build a website?








1

Code editor
• How we write website ?les (like HTML)

2

Web server
• We'll be using a few
different options!
• Plus: Console to upload to the web server

3

Web browser
• Where we interact with websites
• Recommended: Firefox,
Chrome (not Safari!)



HTML Concepts
• HyperText Markup Language
• We use markup to indicate the structure and role of text or other elements of a web page
• This distinguishes as HTML semantic - it gives meaning
• Some roles/structures
• Heading
• Paragraph
• List



HTML Elements
• HTML consists of tags that describe the type of content, and the web browser decides how to display it
• For example, if we wanted to display the following text
content as a paragraph:
My cat is very grumpy

The HTML element would be:

<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>



HTML Elements parts - regular







Required & Recommended
HTML elements - how many do you see?



HTML Elements parts - self-closing
• Self-closing elements don't contain text content or
other elements
• Often used to insert non-textual elements
• Do NOT have a closing tag
• Examples:
Horizontal rule: <hr/>
Meta: <meta charset="utf-8"/>



Class Coding Goal
Let's make sure everyone's got the basics!

3 min challenge! In pairs, discuss:
How many elements make up this page? Guess the tag name for 3 of the elements!














Why do some elements start on a new line and others don't?







Inline vs Block elements
• When we add multiple images, they display beside each other until there's no more room
These are examples of an inline element
• When we add a heading element or paragraph element, they are displayed on the next line
These are examples of a block element

• CSS is where we can change these default behaviours!













Prior Knowledge Questionnaire
Please open course Moodle to ?nd link!








Homework

Tags: Text Modifiers
Emphasis
<strong>strong</strong> (usually makes text bold)
<em>emphasize</em> (emphasize, usually makes text italicized) Comments: <!-- The web browser will ignore everything here -->



Tags: Images
<img> is a tag used for inserting images to a web page, for example:
<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="lounging gray cat">
Note: It is an self-closing element
src specifies where the image comes from
alt describes the image in case it can't be loaded or for those who use screen readers to browse the Web

What are the 4 parts of this URL?

https://dawsoncollege.gitlab.io/introweb/1-terminology-html/basic-html.html

Communication protocol
• A protocol describes how two entities will communicate (like Morse code!)
• http and https are the main web protocols that describe how browsers and web servers communicate
• What do you think https means?
• secure http



What are the 4 parts of this URL?



https://dawsoncollege.gitlab.io/introweb/1-terminology-html/basic-html.html

Domain name
• The human-readable name of the web server
• We can also think of this as the computer that our browser wants to get a file from



• Domains get more specific from right to left
• .com, .ca, .io are examples of top-level domains	14


Top-level Domain (TLD)
• The rightmost part of the domain name
• Most common TLDs: .com, .org, .net
• Now there are a lot of fun ones:
• .art
• .cool
• .pizza
• .quebec
• .tech



How do you get a domain name?
• A domain name registrar provides domain name
registrations to the public
• They own the rights to domain names and lease them out
• Examples of registrars?



What are the 4 parts of this URL?







https://dawsoncollege.gitlab.io/introweb/1-terminology-html/basic-html.html
Path to the specific file or resource requested
• The rest of the URL indicates where and what the specific file or resource the browser has requested
• The .html at the end tells you the file type that has be requested
• Here, the browser is requesting the file basic-html.html in the folder
1-terminology-html, that is in folder introweb

Practice: Name the parts of this URL
http://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas



HTML Element attributes & values
Consider this element:
<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="lounging gray cat">

src and alt are called attributes



HTML Element attributes & values
Consider this element:
<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="lounging gray cat">

src and alt are called attributes
The part after the = and between double quotes "" are values

When we get to creating forms, this is VERY important terminology to remember!!!


Draw what this code would produce:

Solution:
















Class Coding
What's new?





How do you know you're coding
correctly?




Validator!
https: /validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input This helps us code correctly, not just "it works".










In the Setup Lab, images were in the assets folder.
Do you remember how images were referenced in the <img> tag?



Use a relative path
Relative path: Reference to document or file relative to the file it is being used in, in the context of the folder structure.
Examples:
• If I am working on index.html, the relative path to an image called cat.png in the images folder is "images/cat.png"
• If I am working on a file in class03, then the relative path to brodie.jpg is "../brodie.jpg"
• ../ indicates going up a folder






Relative path practice
If you are working on a file called index.html from the server folder, how would you insert an image called puppy.png located in the dogs folder?

If you are working on a file called catpage.html in the templates folder, how would you insert an image called kitty.gif located in the cats folder?




What media can we use?
What images/media are developers allowed to use in a web page?
• Our own content
• Free-to-use content

Before you use content that is not yours:
Check the copyright to see if what you intend to do is allowed by the author!

Media citation in HTML














Today's Tag: Figure
A way to insert an image with a caption! Example:
<figure>
<img src="images/cat.png" alt="white cat">
<figcaption>
         <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/7788419@N05/15218475961"> "Cat"</a> by Tony is licensed under CC BY 2.0
</figcaption>
</figure>
NOTE: This is for when you want to add a caption to an image, images without a caption only need to use the <img> tag.



Today's tags: hyperlinks
There are three main uses for the anchor tag:
1. Jumping to a specific part of a web page using id, like the Contact heading
2. External links (going to a different web page or website)
3. Opening the default email or phone app to contact a specified email or phone number.



Today's tags: hyperlinks
<a href="https://example.com" target="blank">Clickable text</a>

a is for anchor
href attribute specifies where the link goes
target attribute tells the browser how to open the link
blank value opens the link in a new tab



Today's tags: clickable image
We can also use images as hyperlinks, like this:

<a href="https://example.com">
<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="cat">
</a>


Best Web resource

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/



Today's tags: Sectioning content
Use MDN Content categories to explore what these elements are for:
• <main>
• <header>
• <footer>
• <nav>
• <article>
• <aside>
• <section>











Homework
• Prepare for Quiz 2 on the content from the code today + these slides!
• Prepare for the first lab assignment: See Moodle for instructions




PDGE Week 3: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)



Quiz Revision
• Earn back 50% of the marks you missed
• How? Resubmit your quiz with the correct answers AND an explanation why you got the question incorrect.
• Examples:
In question 2, I felt rushed and made this mistake: ...
In question 5, I confused the terminology and thought that x meant y, but now I realize...
• DUE the class/lab after the quizzes are returned



Agenda
• 
Quiz #2
• Relative Path practice
• Multi-page websites
• <link> element
• CSS syntax
• Web colours
• Class coding: CSS properties
• Content sectioning
• Box Model
• Pseudo-selectors
• CSS Diner






Relative path practice
1. If you are working on an HTML file in the
/ (root) folder, what is the path to an image in the work folder?
2. If you are working on an HTML file called cory.html in the cory folder, what is the path to an image in the lib folder?
3. Pick two folders and ask a neighbour to give what the path between them would be.

















Multi-page websites




Adding a link to another page of the
same website
Use the <a> element but the href value is a relative path to the file it refers to, on the server
Practice:
From index.html, create a hyperlink to
about.html
From about.html, create a hyperlink to
contactus.html
From contactus.html, create a hyperlink to
index.html

















CSS TIME
Time to STYLE!
























Today's Tag: <link>
** NOT for hyperlinks!**
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="homepage.css">

• You can name your CSS file anything as long as it ends in
.css
• Like with <a> the href value is a relative path to your CSS file



CSS Syntax & Terminology



Representing colours in CSS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15aqFQQVBWU&t=43s
In CSS, we can write colours in many ways:
• HTML Color Name
h1 { color: red; }
• Hexadecimal
h1 { color: #ff0000; }
• Decimal
h1 { color: rgb(255, 0, 0); }
• Percentage
h1 { color: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%); }



What about transparency?
We need another setting: the alpha channel!
Alpha also goes from 0 to 255, but represented as a number
between 0 and 1
0 = transparent
1 = opaque















Class Coding
What elements need to be styled?



Multiple CSS selectors
h1, h2 {
font-family: 'Segoe Print', serif;
}

This CSS rule applies to BOTH h1 and h2 elements. How does this differ from the following?

h1 h2 {
font-family: 'Segoe Print', serif;
}



Nested CSS selectors
ul li {
list-style-type: '	';
}

This CSS rule only applies to li elements nested inside a ul element.
This means it won't apply to li elements nested inside ol elements.










What if we want to apply the same style to multiple elements?





What if we want to apply the same style
to multiple elements?
1. Add class attribute + value in HTML:
<hr class="dashed"/>
<hr/>
<hr class="dashed"/>

2. Select it in CSS with the dot . :
.dashed {
border: 5px dashed blue;
}

Class attributes are selected by a dot .





What if we want to apply the same style
to multiple elements?
An element can have multiple classes applied to it:
<li class="bold italic">Ricky Rubio</li>

The class values are all within quotes "" separated by a space.

What content sectioning would you apply to this page?
• <main>
• <header>
• <footer>
• <nav>
• <article>
• <section>



Today's Tag: <span>
Inline element used to group content for styling
• It has no effect on content unless you style it
• Think of it like an empty, outer canvas box
• It is non-semantic
Before you add a span, you must be able to explain to your teacher why you need it, and no other semantic element works
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span



Today's Tag: <div>
Block element used to group content for styling,
• Otherwise like span, non-semantic
Before you add a div, you must be able to explain to your teacher why you need it, and no other semantic element works
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div











Class Coding
Which elements need to be styled?
Which properties?







CSS Box Model





















CSS Box Model
In action with Inspect



Today's CSS: margin & padding
All elements can be given a border, margin, and
padding.
For the element:
<p>Lorem <em>ipsum</em></p>
With this CSS:
em {
padding: 10px;
border: 1px dashed black; margin: 10px;
}
If the black dashed line is the border, what is the yellow area? What is the purple?



Today's CSS Properties
display: inline-flex;

Agenda
• 
Quiz #3
• Specificity practice
• Forms
• GET + POST
• Class coding
• Client-side validation
• Homework: Test #1 in two weeks



Specificity & cascading order - what colours will the list text be?


.main { color: red;
}
.special {
color: orange; font-weight: bold;
}
li {
color: green;
}

<ul class="main">
<li>Item One</li>
<li>Item Two
<ul>
<li>2.1</li>
<li>2.2</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Item Three
<ul class="special">
<li>3.1
<ul>
<li>3.1.1</li>
<li>3.1.2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3.2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



Form-associated elements
<form>
<input/>
<label>
<button>

<fieldset>, <legend>
<textarea>
<select>, <option>

















Forms
Let's start here:








Okay but how do you make the button work?
Form submission



<form> attributes
Two important form attributes:
<form action="path/to/script" method="get">
...
</form>
• The action attribute defines which script on the web server the form data will be sent to when it is submitted
• The method attribute defines which type of HTTP request
will be sent

So, to submit a form, you need a server!

















Let's borrow Google's server:












Exercise: Borrow the W3C Validator server



Method: HTTP GET or POST?
GET: we are requesting information from a server, and our arguments go
into the URL

Example HTTP request to W3 Validator:
GET /nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsonic.dawsoncollege.qc.ca
Corresponding URL:
https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsonic.dawsoncollege.qc.ca


Since arguments go into the URL, the request can be bookmarked, or the link shared



Method: GET or POST?
POST: we are sending information to the server, and our arguments go into
the request header
Example HTTP request to Dawson's server sonic:
POST /users/ lastname: Lopez firstname: Lei
Corresponding URL: https: /sonic.dawsoncollege.qc.ca The arguments aren't visible in the URL!



Method: GET or POST?

When does it make sense to make a GET request?



What situations require a POST request?



Let's build an HTTP request


HTML
<form action="users.js" method="get">
<input type="text" name="lastname" />
<input type="text" name="firstname" />
</form>

Request
GET /users/? lastname="Lopez" firstname="Lei"









What's the corresponding URL?
REQUEST
GET /users/? lastname=Lopez& firstname=Lei& country=Canada

Corresponding URL, if the server is located at sonic.dawsoncollege.qc.ca
https://sonic.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/users/?lastname=Lopez&firstname=Lei&country=Canada

The part of the URL after the ? Is called the
query string



What's the corresponding URL?
REQUEST
GET /students/? id=1234567&
username=brodie& program=Fisheries&
What's the corresponding URL if the server is at https://catcollege.quebec ?



What's the corresponding URL?
REQUEST
POST /students/ id=7654321
username=fitz password=itsatrap
What's the corresponding URL if the server is at https://catcollege.quebec ?

Form controls
Definition: Elements that take input from a user

<input/>
<textarea></textarea>
<select><option>...</option></select>



label
For usability and accessibility, we include an explicit label for each form control.
• The value of the for attribute on all <label> elements is the id of the form control with which it is associated
• When a user clicks or touches/taps a label, the browser passes the
focus to its associated input

<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" name="user_name" >



Input
<input type="text" name="user-name" id="name" />

The input element is a field that the user fills/selects
There are many type attribute values. Here are some:
• text - single line of text
• email, tel
• radio, checkbox
• date, month, time, week
• number, range



General <input> tag attributes
type - the type of input requested from the user (defaults to text)
name - the name of the form control, it is submitted to the server along
with the input entered by the user
id - unique identifier useful for the label for attribute
required - user must enter something
placeholder - text that is shown in the control before the user types
anything
• Useful to give the user a little hint on the expected data (e.g., an
email control might have "e.g., person@example.com")



select
How we provide a dropdown menu of options Basic usage:
<label for="pet-select">Choose a pet:</label>
<select name="pets" id="pet-select">
<option value="">--Choose an option--</option>
<option value="dog">Dog</option>
<option value="cat">Cat</option>
</select>



textarea
Like an <input type="text"> but used for multiple lines of user text input

<label for="message">Message:</label>
<textarea id="message" name="user_message" cols="30" rows="5"
placeholder="Type here"></textarea>







button
<button type="submit">Send your message</button>

3 possible type values: submit, reset, or button.
• type="submit" sends the data to the webpage specified by the form's
action attribute
• type="reset" resets all the form controls to their default values
• type="button" does nothing by default! We would have to code it with
JavaScript!



Structuring a form - fieldset and legend
<fieldset> element creates a group of form controls that share the same
purpose, for styling and semantic purposes.

<legend> element adds a label to the fieldset
The text content of the <legend> formally describes the purpose of the
<fieldset> it is included inside.













Client-side form validation
Help the user enter the right data!



Why validate a form?
• To try to send the right data in the right format so our server-side code works
• Protect user data (require long passwords)
• Type password with stars!
• Protect server (web security!)



Why validate a form?
required
• Forces field to have a value
minlength="8" & maxlength="15"
• Requires a text input or textarea to have a minimum/maximum character length
min="1" & max="12"
• Validation for a number input
• Greater than a minimum value
• Less than a maximum value



Form validation in CSS
:valid - Allows us to style an input that's valid
Example:
input:valid, textarea:valid { background-color: palegreen;
}
:invalid - Allows us to style an input that's not valid
:focus - Styles an element that's clicked on (in focus)
Example:
input:invalid:focus { background-color: red; }

PDGE Week 5 Class: Intro to JS + Review



Agenda
• Common Assignment Issues
• Intro to JavaScript

• Review Kahoot!
• Extra Practice problems
• Makeup Quizzes (for students who have booked with me)



Common Assignment Issues
• Design: differences not explained in enough detail
• Git: commit messages should describe action
• Media: some images were captioned as in the public domain when they were not!
• HTML: Vague title (tab text)
• CSS: No backup font-family

















JavaScript
What was going on in calculate.js?






Components of a web page






Consider Python...
What characteristics make up a
programming language?
LIST AT LEAST 5 THINGS



What is JavaScript?
• High-level programming language written for humans
• Similar constructs: variables, conditions, if statements, functions
• Dynamic typing - you do not declare variable types and variables can be reassigned something of another type
• Not pre-compiled
• Pro: Can easily run on the browser
• Con: must end lines in a semi-colon ;



How easy is it to try in the browser?
Super easy, barely an inconvenience! Find the Console from Inspect dev tools




const width = 5.0; const height = 3;
const rectangleArea = width * height;




Types
• What types does Python have? In JavaScript:
• number - integer or floating type
• string - one or more characters
• boolean - true or false
• undefined - used for unassigned variables
• object (a more complex type)
• null - absence of object values




Challenge: Use the typeof() function to output each of these types.



Ways to declare a variable in JS
1. const
For variables that will not change, use this by default!

2. let
For variables that will change :)

3. var
The unsafe, old version of let DO NOT use Most common in generated code :(



How do you add JS to your website?
In HTML, in the head section:
<script src="script.js" defer></script>

When the browser receives HTML, it constructs a model of the HTML.
When it reads a <link> element, it loads the file (like a stylesheet) to apply to the page.
When it reads a <script> element, it loads the JavaScript file to apply to the page.
defer tells the browser to wait to run until the HTML and other files are all loaded



How do you add JS to your website?
In HTML, in the head section:
<script src="script.js" defer></script>

This is the only accepted way to use JavaScript in this course. Do you recognize the src attribute?
Note: There are other ways to use JS from an HTML file (embedded within head, inline event handlers), but these ways are not recommended. It is better to have a separation of concerns, with HTML and JS separated. DO NOT submit these other ways in this class.



Starting a js script
'use strict';

This declaration will make sure that code is run in strict mode. strict mode?
* "Avoid silly mistakes" mode
* JavaScript was designed in a way that is easy to make mistakes :(
* Strict mode makes it easier to find bugs!



Starter script.js
Using what you know of how to write functions, fill in the missing function that does this:
Calculate and return the cost of the flight, assuming that it is the input fee plus $2 dollars per kilometre (also an input).

Try the button to test if it works!



Starter script.js
What do you think these lines do?

const firstButton = document.querySelector("button"); firstButton.addEventListener("click", showFlightCost);



Starter script.js
What about these lines?

const fee = document.getElementById("fee").value; const km = document.getElementById("km").value; const cost = calculateFlightCost(fee, km);

document.querySelector("output").innerText = cost;












Review Kahoot!
Go to kahoot.it or QR code :)

1. Spot & fix the bugs
2. Draw the form
3. Write the URL sent to the server
<form action="https://example.com/subscribe" method="get">
<label for="choice">Choose an option:</label>
<select name="choice" id="choices" >

<option
value="option1">Option
1</option>
<option
value="option2">Option
2</option>
<option
value="option3">Option
3</option>
<input
type="checkbox"
id="filter"
name="filter"
value="true">
<label
for="filter">



<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>







More drawing & labelling practice
1. Draw a form with at least 3 form inputs, then:
Trade with a peer and have them label what elements would be needed, along with the attributes.
2. Draw out the box model of an element with the corresponding CSS declarations.
3. Label a URL with its 5 parts.
4. Label the 4 components of a CSS ruleset.
5. Label the 5 components of an HTML element

















Prep for A2











Homework
• Prepare for Assignment 2
Research your formula:
-What inputs does it need?
-What units are they in? Min/max values?
-Find/create an image relating to it
• Study for Test 1 - check reference sheet
• Submit Quiz Revisions :)










PDGE Week 7 Class:
More JS



HTML docs are a (family) tree
child element
HTML elements nested directly inside another element (their parent element)
parent element
An HTML element that contains other elements (their children)
descendant
Any HTML elements that are nested in another element (can be deeper than a child element)
Q: What are the descendants of body?




Draw the Tree for this code: (3min)
<body>
<header>Header</header>
<main>
<nav>

<ul>


</ul>
</nav>
<article>


<li>Home</li>
<li>Next</li>

<section>Section 1</section>
<section>Section 2</section>
</article>
</main>
</body>



Using the Document Object Model (DOM)
The DOM is the programming interface that JavaScript uses to get and change the contents of the HTML document

The window, document, all elements and attributes and text nodes are available as objects
The document and window objects are the objects you will use often
window represents the browser (kind of)
document represents the html document



Try it in console! (2min)
* Get information from the browser:

* window.innerHeight - try resizing your window, what happens?
* window.location - what is this?

* document.doctype
* document.title













Query Selector Practice
Please download the starter code and assets for Week 7!







Fun in browser Console! (10min)
Without adding new id or class attributes, write the JS to:
• Store the first image into a non-changing variable called firstImg
• Store the second fieldset into into a non-changing variable called
secondFieldset
• Check if the the pop checkbox is checked
• Get the user input for Name and make it lowercase
• Change the Pets label text to Animals
• Add an exclamation point JS Practice h2
• Change the first image from brodielee.jpg to brodie-nap.jpg



How to get elements from the DOM
Two helpful functions:
* Find the first element for a given selector - use
document.querySelector('cssSelector');
* Find a list all elements for a given selector - use
document.querySelectorAll('cssSelector');
You can get a specific element with array/list/collection syntax [#] e.g., document.querySelectorAll('h2')[0] -> finds the first h2 element in the page







Terminology Check!



Using properties Accessing
let content = paragraph.innerText;

Assigning
paragraph.innerText = "new text";

Using methods/functions Getting
let url = image.getAttribute('src');

Setting
image.setAttribute('src', 'diff.png');







Terminology Check!



Using properties
.innerText is like a variable that you can access and change its value directly

Using methods/functions
.getAttribute() and .setAttribute() are functions.
You need to call the functions with parameters to get or change the values.



Getting values
element.getAttribute('attributename');
==>returns the value of the given attribute
==>Try in console: getting the alt attribute of the image on the page
element.innerText;
==>returns the text content of an element
==>Try in console: getting the text content of the button



Setting values
element.setAttribute('attributeName', 'attributeValue');
==>Sets the attribute of an element to 'attributeValue'
==>Try in console: Set the href value of an a element to the Dawson homepage

element.innerText = 'value';
==>Sets the text content of an element to 'value';



== vs ===
There are two types of comparison operators in JS

The equality operator == checks if the values are equal. It will convert and compare values even if they have different types

The strict equality operator === checks if the values are equal AND they have the same type






Let's try it out - What do you think?
'1' == 1
'1' === 1
'1' === "1"

5 == 5.0
5 === 5.0

0 == false
0 === false



What do you think?
'1' == 1 true
'1' === 1 false
'1' === "1" true

5 == 5.0 true
5 === 5.0 true

0 == false true
0 === false false






falsey and truthy values
A falsey value is a value that is treated as false when used in a boolean expression (using non-strict equality)
Examples of falsey values:
• false
• 0 and -0
• "" (empty string)
• NaN (not a number, which has the type of number	)
   • undefined (an uninitialized variable) Everything that is not falsey is truthy!
LESSON: ALWAYS USE STRICT EQUALITY IN JAVASCRIPT!!!



Event-driven  Programming

Event-driven  Programming























1: User interacts with page	2: User action
produces an event


19



Event-driven  Programming
















1: User interacts with page	2: User action
produces a browser event

We want some sort of response that makes a change in the webpage!

3: An event listener added by a developer "hears" & responds to the event






1: User interacts with page	2: User action
produces a browser event



Event-driven  Programming
3: An event listener added by a developer "hears" & responds to the event





1: User interacts with page	2: User action

Template for handling events
// find the element (like a button) that will produce the event let element = document.querySelector('selector');

// register an event listener on the element
// set the function that will handle the event
element.addEventListener('eventName',  functionName);

// code the event handler function that is called when the event is produced
function functionName() {
...
}
Task: Code a click event on the JS Practice h2 heading that adds an exclamation point each time it is clicked



Unpack the addEventListener code
//listen for the event, and register the event handler button.addEventListener('click', updateText);



The HTML element (or its ancestor) that will fire the event



Unpack the addEventListener code
//listen for the event, and register the event handler button.addEventListener('click', updateText);
Name of the event as a string.
There are different events possible, for example:
• The user selects, clicks, or hovers over the element.
• The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
• A form is submitted.



Unpack the addEventListener code
//listen for the event, and register the event handler button.addEventListener('click', updateText);

Name of the function that will handle the event
Notice NO parentheses - you are not calling the function.








Task: Cycle images on click (5min)
Code the JS to cycle between the two Brodie pictures in assets when the image element is clicked.



Toggling a class
In JS, the classList is the list of class= attributes applied to an element :)
Example usage:
CSS
.rotate {
transform: rotate(180deg);
}

JS
<element>.classList.toggle("rotate");



Toggling a class
Task: Write a function that finds the first image and flips it by toggling the class rotate for the image's classList.

function flipImage() {
const firstImg = document.querySelector("img");
firstImg.classList.toggle("rotate");
}



Keyboard events + event objects!
Let's tie it to a key press!

document.addEventListener('keyup',  handleKey);

function handleKey(e) {
if (e.key === "f") { flipImage();
}
}



NOTE: e is the event object that is automatically sent to the event handler!



What else can we do with event objects?
Add the following line to one of your event handlers:
console.log(e.type);
What does it do?

Add the following line to one of your event handlers:
console.log(e.target);
What does it do?
With e.target, we can update the element that triggered the event!

Challenge: Add an event listener to document.body that toggles the border class on the element that was clicked on.









What other browser events exist?
And where would I ask you to find them?





Try to trigger 3 different events below:
You'll need to register a new event listener on an appropriate target (element,
document, etc.) with one of the event handlers you already have, or a new one!


* mouseover
* mouseout
* mousedown
* mouseup
* contextmenu
* keydown
* keyup
* dblclick
* click
* 
load
* pageshow
* scroll
* blur
* onfocus
* select
* wheel
* input
* copy
* 
cut
* paste
* resize



Using a canvas to draw
The canvas is a browser built-in set of HTML and JavaScript that allows us to draw (hello math functions!)
We'll stick with a circle for now
:)
Who wants to move it around??



Using a canvas to draw
1. Add an event listener that listens for the keydown event and will call the handleKey event handler.
2. Code the event handler function
handleKey
a. Each key (w, a, s, d) must adjust the x and y value according to the graphics coordinates
b. At the end of the function, the function drawCircle can be called with the new x/y values :)



Using a canvas to draw
• Add the ability to use the arrow keys in the
existing if/else if statements
• Change the colour of the circle to be a
gradient from one colour to another
• Try making the circle move faster or slower
• Add a key that increases/decreases the size
of the circle
• Try changing the circle into another shape!









PDGE Week 8 Class: Backend + Flask



Agenda
• Quiz 5
• Git Feature Flow
• Virtual environments
• Backend: Flask! Jinja!





Quiz #5
1. Name & explain 1 browser event other than click/keyup/keydown. (2pts)
2. Assuming that e is an event object, what does e.target return? (1pt)
3. Draw the DOM tree for this HTML code snippet: (7pts)
<body>
<header>Hello World!</header>
<main>
<p>My <span>first</span> website.
Hope you <span>en<span class="capital">joy</span></span>!
</p>
</main>
Thanks for reading!
</body>











Git Feature Flow
One way to work on the same codebase together efficiently :)


Git Workflow




pull again





push



Typical git sequence
1. git clone ==> Done once per computer to connect the computer to the repository and download everything in the server into a specific folder. If this is not the first time you're working from this computer, then you would do git pull here instead (see step 6)
2. (outside of git) Make whatever changes you want. These changes must be within the folder cloned to git in step one
3. git add specificFileOrFolder or git add . ==> This adds the file/folders (or everything) to git on your
local computer so that it is tracked
4. git status ==> To confirm that all the files you want show up as added
5. git commit -m "Please put a useful message here describing the purpose of the latest work" ==>
To create a snapshot (on your local computer still!)
6. git pull origin ==> To download any updates made in the server since step 1
7. 	Cross your fingers ==> Hope that there is no merge conflict! If so, resolve the merge conflict! (next lecture!)
8. git push origin ==> To upload your updates to the server.



Pull scenarios
Typically, 3 different scenarios that can happen during the second pull
• Case 1: The pull works with no changes at all (yay!)
• Case 2: The pull works but involved an automatic merge.
• Depending on your computer settings, you may receive a confirmation
dialog notifying you of this (MERGE_MSG)
• Happens if developers both make compatible changes to the same file. For example, if they each add to the same file.
• Case 3: The pull requires a manual merge.
• Happens if developers both make incompatible changes to the same file.
• For example, if they each modify the same line of code - which modification is the desired one!?

Scenario 1

X.txt



Y.txt

pull	pull




push

push









Alice update s X.txt




Alice





Sam

Sam updates Y.txt

X.txt





Scenario 1 - working on different files -
Automatic merge
- Suppose there are 2 files in the code repository: X.txt, Y.txt
- Alice and Sam both download their individual copies at the same time.
- Alice changes X.txt and pushes the change to the remote server
- Sam changes Y.txt and plans to push the change to the remote server.
Before doing so, they repull the latest code from the server.
- In this case, Sam's computer will now have a version of code including
both changes (i.e. both X.txt and Y.txt are there)

X.txt

15 25

Scenario 2

10 20 30 40



1. What happens when
Sam repulls?

2. What contents would you like to show up on the server?
 Alice adds 15 between
10 and 20


pull




push

^	^

pull
    
If Sam were allowed to push their change to the remote repository, then it would undo Alice's change!




Sam adds 25
bAeuttwo-emeenrge2! 0
and 30




Alice	Sam




Scenario 2 : working on the same file - Automatic Merge
Suppose there is a file X.txt in the code repository with the following contents: 10 20 30 40
Alice and Sam both download their individual copies at the same time. So, on each of their computers the file X.txt contains text: 10 20 30 40
1) Alice adds the 15 between 10 and 20 and pushes the change.
 - Alice's version is now: 10 15 20 30 40 (which is also the version on the server now)
2) Sam adds the 25 between 20 and 30.
- Sam's version is now: 10 20 25 30 40




Scenario 2 : working on the same file - Automatic Merge (continued)
3) If Sam were allowed to push their change to the remote repository, then it would undo Alice's change! So, a warning comes that forces Sam to download the latest code. When this is done, the source repository system will merge automatically the two together on Sam's computer.
The source repository system is able to infer that the final version of the file should be (10 15 20 25 30 40) and this version will now be on Sam's computer. They can push it to the server without erasing Alice's change!

Scenario 3
1. What happens when Sam
repulls?

2. What contents would you



pull

X.txt




push

15
10 20 30 40
^
pull

like to show up on the server?




 Alice adds 15 between
10 and 20

Sam adds 10 and 20

Alice	Sam




Scenario 2 : working on the same file - Conflicting Merge
Suppose there is a file X.txt in the code repository with the following contents: 10 20 30 40
Alice and Sam both download their individual copies at the same time. So, on each of their computers the file X.txt contains text: 10 20 30 40
1) Alice adds the 15 between the first 10 and 20 and pushes the change.
 - Alice's version is now: 10 15 20 30 40 (which is also the version on the server now)
2) Sam adds the 13 also between 10 and 20.
- Sam's version is now: 10 13 20 30 40



Scenario 3: Resolving a conflicting merge
The source repository system is not able to determine whether the final file should be:
10 13 15 20 30 40
or
10 15 13 20 30 40
Sam needs to manually merge the files together as the computer cannot infer which edit makes more sense!



How to avoid merge conflicts
• PULL before pushing
• Small changes: If you make lots of small commits instead of a few big commits, then it is less likely you'll create a new bug. If you do create a bug, then it's easier to identify.
• Rollbacks / reverts: This is a feature within Git that will let us undo a commit that someone else (or ourselves) made (this is reactive but sometimes unavoidable)
• Code reviews: This is the idea of having someone else check over your work before you commit it (proactive)



How to fix merge conflicts
• Git will tell you why it could not create the merge for you
• You will need to edit the specific file(s) that it had trouble merging (you can find them by searching for <<<
• After editing them, you will create a new commit, with those edited files (by using the command git add).
• After committing the change, the merge conflict will be resolved.
• You can then push to the server. When you do this push, there will be two commits pushed simultaneously.












What gets sent to the server?




Time to code the backend!



Time to code the backend!
• So... we could process those HTTP requests ourselves
• OR we can use a framework!
• Examples:
• Django (python)
• Ruby on Rails (ruby)
• Express.js (JavaScript)
• Laravel (PHP)
• This course: Flask

















Flask
A lightweight Python web framework



Virtual Environments
• A way to make sure we use the correct Python + library versions
for each project we're working on!
• venv module in Python :)
• Resource:  https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/#virtual-environments
• Don't forget to activate your environment!



Flask - Hello World
• Create a file called hello.py
• Minimal Flask app:

• In Terminal, run flask --app hello run



What does .route() do?
Allows us to define different pages for our users to visit :)
This syntax declares a decorator, which adds the function under it to our instance of Flask :)

What was the bold part of this URL called? https://example.com/pages?key=value

Now we can call it a route, because we'll be coding the route to the
response for a given request!

















Download
index.html (bare bones HTML)







Let's upgrade
Create a new file called app.py with these updates:

from flask import Flask, render_template


app = Flask(  name  )


@app.route("/") def index():
return render_template("index.html")

This assumes that index.html is in a folder called templates/







Let's personalize :)
In templates/index.html, add Hi, {{ name }} to the body text, then update:

from flask import Flask, render_templates, request
app = Flask( name ) @app.route("/")
def index():
name = request.args["name"]
return render_template("index.html", name=name)







Open the page
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?name=Brodie



What happens if you go to the plain URL? http://127.0.0.1:5000/



Oops! 3min Task: Write an if-else statement that uses the name if it's
in the request args and "world" if not.







JK there's a better way
if "name" in request.args:
    name = request.args["name"] else:
name = "world"

Becomes:

name = request.args.get("name", "world")







Let's attach all this to a form!
In index.html, replace the Hi, {{ name }} with this form:


And now we need to add a new route to app.py :)

3min Task: Add a new route to app.py for the path /greet that returns the greet.html file

What do we need to make this URL work? http://127.0.0.1:5000/greet.html?name=Brodie







Client vs Server-side validation
We can add required and minlength, etc. client-side, but that
doesn't prevent the user from deleting those!

Server-side validation is needed to defend against malicious users, while client-side validation is best for helping users.







What's reading {{ name }} ??
A templating library called Jinja







Are you tired of typing HTML?
Let's harness the power of Jinja templating!
Create a new file called layout.html in templates/ with the standard content:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>Flask Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>







Are you tired of typing HTML?
Let's harness the power of Jinja templating!
Create a new file called layout.html in templates/ with the standard content:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>Flask Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
{% block body %}{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>







BURN all the boilerplate!
In index.html, we can now delete all these lines:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>Flask Practice</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>







BURN all the boilerplate!
So now we're left with:




<form action="/greet" method="get">
<input type="text" name="name">
<button type="Submit">Greet</button>
</form>







BURN all the boilerplate!
But now we need to add the Jinja:
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}

<form action="/greet" method="get">
<input type="text" name="name">
<button type="Submit">Greet</button>
</form>

{% endblock %}







What about POST?
What happens when you change from get to post in
index.html?

Oop, let's fix that in app.py

@app.route("/greet", methods=["POST"]) def greet():
name = request.form.get("name", "world")
return render_template("greet.html", name=name)



Network tab in developer tools



You can creep on your requests to any website server!







Conditionals in Jinja
We can let Jinja handle the default value!

@app.route("/greet", methods=["POST"])
def greet():
name = request.form.get("name", "world")
return render_template("greet.html", name=name)







Conditionals in Jinja
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block body %} Hi,
{% if name %}
{{ name }}
{% else %} world
{% endif %}
{% endblock %}







Challenge: Code a backend for our form!
Provided:
• Empty app.py
• static/brodie-nap.jpg (in Flask, assets are stored in static/)

In templates:
• failure.html
• Non-Jinja index.html
• Basic layout.html
• Starter success.html







Challenge: Code a backend for our form!
1. Code app.py to setup Flask
2. Make sure the form in HTML sends a post request to /submit
3. Code the route for "/" to display index.html
4. Code the POST to /submit that displays failure.html if name or email are missing; otherwise, it displays success.html sending the request.form to the template
5. Make index.html use Jinja templating from layout.html
6. Update success.html with the request.form name, as well as the keys and values, using a Jinja for loop
7. Update app.py and index.html to source Pets & Music from arrays setup in app.py

PDGE Week 12 Class: Presenting Data



Agenda
• Data is a file
• .gitlab-ci.yml
• Deploying a Flask app
• Lightning Talks



All code + data are files
• In A4, when we kill the server, the submitted scores go away :(
• To store, we need a database
• In the class we'll simulate that with a csv file
• In production, this would be TERRIBLE practice (security risk)
• But this is for learning :)
• Clone the starter code & explore, what is the website doing?
• Open .data/scores.csv







Save the submission to the csv
import csv

Before we return the success.html:

with open('.data/scores.csv', 'a', newline='') as csv_file: data = csv.writer(csv_file, delimiter=',') data.writerow([name, score])







Let's implement the /scores page







How about a graph of the data?









How about a graph of the data?
import csv, matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generateScoresGraph(scores):
name_data = [data["name"] for data in scores]
scores_data = [data["score"] for data in scores] plt.plot(name_data, scores_data, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='blue') plt.xlabel('Names')
plt.ylabel('Scores')
plt.title('Scores Graph') plt.savefig('static/graph.png') plt.close()



.gitlab-ci.yml
• Why do we need pipelines?
• To validate, test, lint, prepare code before publishing
• How?
• In GitLab, and many other systems, write the instructions in a YAML file
• Infrastructure developers write the code that reads those instructions :) (Thank you to them!!)



How to read .gitlab-ci.yml
• Title of Job
• Stage of Pipeline (defaults: build, test, deploy)
• Image: Sandbox with necessary software
• Things to run before the job script

• The commands to run!

• If the job is allowed to fail for the pipeline
to succeed



How to read .gitlab-ci.yml
• busybox is a minimal container
• Title of Job: create-pages
• pages is GitLab Pages-specific

• rules determine when a job is run This one only runs the create- pages job on a push to the main branch
• No commands to run!



Deploying a Flask app
• What do you need to deploy a Flask app?
• Server
• computer with flask + libraries installed
• has your website code
• discoverable on the Internet/Web
• Unfortunately, that's annoying to manage or expensive :(



Render
• Free tier! With no credit card needed!
• But apps will sleep
• Cannot handle unlimited requests
• https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask
• Try it!







Lightning Talks (Nov 19/26)
Prepare 4 to 5-min talk on a web dev topic that teaches something new (& hopefully useful) for your peers.
1. See Moodle for the list of ideas (based on your answers)
2. Select your topic by signing up to the form linked on Moodle
3. Pick your timeslot on Moodle
4. Prepare presentation materials (slides/demo/Kahoot/etc.)
• MUST be doable from the teacher station / accessible via a browser
• Submit to Moodle: if not, you will have to present sans material
5. PRACTICE, out loud at least a couple times







Lightning Talks (Nov 19/26)
Points to cover:
• What is the tool/skill/software for?
• Pros and cons? Alternatives?
• How is it helpful to your peers?
• How can they learn more?



Homework
• A4 Fixup
• Select topic + prepare lightning talk
• Complete Project Phase 1 tasks
