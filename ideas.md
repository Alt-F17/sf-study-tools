DONE: [ ] Populate


- [X] Louisa ConcepTests
DONE: [ ] Populate


- [X] Stack VS Queue
DONE


- [ ] Pandas DataFrame playground with small datasets
Simple Dataset of simulated grades for Louisa's class.
Challenge to go from X = assigned grades, Y = Student names, to opposite using Pandas.
Challenge to graph the grades for each student using Matplotlib. 


- [X] "Spot the Bug" challenges with common Python errors
DONE: [ ] Populate


- [ ] Super Duper Hard Python Problems
Python problems that are too hard for the average EXAM Prep.
Designed to require a lot of thought and to tackle multiple concepts at once.
Implement a test suite to test the code.


- [ ] File I/O simulation sandbox
Split into 3 parts:
Side bar containing a list of files and their types.
Code editor to pass python scripts.
Section showing the contents of the active file and the position of the pointer.
Challenge to read a file and print the contents to the console.
Challenge to take in the contents of a file and write them to a new file with a different name and format.
Challenge to take in the contents of a file and write them to a JSON file.
Validate the results for each challenge and show a success message.


- [ ] OOP class hierarchy diagram builder
Use animal hierarchy as an example.
Create a class diagram of the animal hierarchy.
Create animals in subclasses and show the relationships between them.


- [ ] Step-by-step animator
Explanation for each step of the algorithm.
For a typed snippet of code, go line by line and calculate the space and time complexity of each line.
Preset Algorithms to include: Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort || Fibonacci, Factorial, Binary search.

- [ ] Complexity calculator
Calculate the time and space complexity of a given algorithm.
ERRORS: make sure the code lets the user know if the code is not correct.
Line by line complexity calculator.
Final verdict of the complexity of the algorithm with a breakdown explination.


- [X] Python terminal emulator for practice
DONE


- [ ] Python concept map navigator
Floating concept map of Python concepts and their relationships.
Drag around the map to see how concepts are related.
Short description of each concept when hovered.


- [X] Other / More Ressources
DONE
