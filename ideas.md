FIX: [ ]
Split into 3 parts:
Side bar containing a list of files and their types.
Code editor to pass python scripts.
Section showing the contents of the active file and the position of the pointer.
Challenge to read a file and print the contents to the console.
Challenge to take in the contents of a file and write them to a new file with a different name and format.
